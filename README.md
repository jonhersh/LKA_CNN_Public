# LKA_CNN_Public
 Public code to implement ResNet-CNN model for Sri Lanka Poverty Mapping Project

Note, this code is only for explanatory and demonstration purposes. Neither the full set of image tiles nor the GN poverty rates can be shared publicly. The listed GN poverty rates are randomly assigned and do not reflect true rates. Despite this, I thought it might be instructive for others to see how I implement the CNN model.
